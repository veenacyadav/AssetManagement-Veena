                      Systematic Asset Management includes organising, planning and doing. 
                      Systematic asset management must be considered as one of the first 
                      revolutions in financial technology. However, it quickly became the 
                      industrial secret of many successful funds. Asset management is a 
                      systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, 
                      and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner 
                      (including all costs, risks and performance attributes).

                      Prioritizing the assets based on risks is always required to maintain assets Successfully.
                      there are at least five such risks that primarily contribute to an organization’s failure 
                      to optimally manage their assets: 1) not knowing what they have; 
                      2) over- or under-maintenance; 3) improper operation; 
                      4) improper risk management; and 5) suboptimized asset management systems.
